# Shared Files Analysis - Real File Dependencies

**Generated:** 2025-11-27  
**Analysis:** Internal project files only (no node_modules)

This analysis tracks actual file dependencies within the project codebase, excluding all external dependencies.

## Methodology

- **Relative imports resolved** to actual file paths
- **Alias imports resolved** to real project locations
- **External dependencies excluded** (react, @mui, @supabase, etc.)
- **Only internal files counted** (apps/, packages/)

## Will be populated by audit-shared.mjs

Run the script to populate this file with real shared file analysis.
